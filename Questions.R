Q1
given two  vectors v1 and v2'

v1 <- seq(1,15,2)
v2 <- seq(2,16,2)

arrange assign to a vector such that alternative elements of v1 and v2 are stacked up
example v3 = c(1,2,3,4,5.....)


Q2
given a vector v1 create a vector v2 having the elements of v1 in forward and reverse order

input: v1 = c(1,3,7)
output: v2 = c(1,3,7,7,3,1)

Q3:
Check if the number is even or odd?
x = 26
Output: "Number is a even number"



Q4
given a number check if the number is a prime or composite number

input : 15
output : "number is composite"


Q5:
given a number list all the prime factors of the number

input : 24
output : 2,3

Q6:
Check if the given word is a palindrome or not
Input : noon
Output: "is a palindrome"


Q5
Advanced:
convert a given integer number into binary

#Questions on functions

#Q1 :
 Wrap the prime number checker into a function

#Q2:
 Wrap the prime factors generator into a function and return a vector of all the prime factors

#Q3:
 Write a function to searh for an element in entire data frame and return True or False if found

#Q4:
 Extend the above function to get the row and column of the instance found

#Q5:
 Write a function to delete every third instance in a vector and return the modefied vector
 input : Vector v1
 output : Modified Vector v2

#Q6:
 Given a numeric v1 return sum of all the elements raised to the power of the elements positions
 in reverse order

 example : v1 = c(1,2,3)
 Output : 8 i.e (1^3+2^2+3^1)
#Q7:
 Write a function to splict string into characters

 #Q7:

 In a vector of strings search for a word occurance and return a vector with Found and NotFound
 inputs : vector of Strings, search word
 example: v1 = c("Is it True", "R is amazing","Very much")
 search word : "is"
 Output: c("Found","Found","Not Found")

#Q8:
 Advanced:
 Remove all redundant spaces if any in a vector of strings
 Input : c("Hello  World","I have two spaces  in between" "This is correct spacing")
 Output: c("Hello World","I have two spaces in between","This is correct spacing")
